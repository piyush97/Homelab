# Troubleshooting: Solutions to Common Issues and Tips for Homelab Setup

Setting up a homelab can be challenging, especially for beginners. This guide provides solutions to common issues and troubleshooting tips for using Proxmox, LXC, Docker, Gluetun, Servarr containers, and handling Linux permission issues.

## Proxmox

### Common Issues

1. **Web Interface Not Accessible**

   - **Solution**: Ensure Proxmox service is running. Use `systemctl status pveproxy` to check the status. Restart if necessary with `systemctl restart pveproxy`. Also, check firewall settings to ensure port 8006 is open.

2. **VMs Not Starting**

   - **Solution**: Check storage availability. Ensure there is enough disk space and memory. Use `df -h` to check disk space and `free -m` for memory. Additionally, verify that the VM configuration is correct and that the VM is not paused or in a locked state.

3. **Backup Failures**
   - **Solution**: Ensure the backup storage location is accessible and has enough space. Check the backup logs for specific error messages. Use `pct backup <vmid>` to manually trigger a backup and diagnose issues.

## LXC Containers

### Common Issues

1. **Container Not Starting**

   - **Solution**: Check container logs using `lxc-start -n <container_name> -F`. Look for error messages and resolve accordingly. Ensure that the container configuration file is correct and that there are no conflicting resource allocations.

2. **Network Issues**

   - **Solution**: Ensure network bridge is correctly configured. Check `/etc/network/interfaces` for correct bridge settings. Verify that the container has a valid IP address and that the host's firewall rules are not blocking traffic.

3. **Resource Limits**
   - **Solution**: Adjust resource limits in the container configuration file. Use `lxc-cgroup -n <container_name> <resource> <value>` to set specific resource limits.

## Docker

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Daemon Not Running**

   - **Solution**: Start Docker service using `systemctl start docker`. Check status with `systemctl status docker`. If the daemon fails to start, check the Docker logs in `/var/log/docker.log` for error messages.

2. **Container Not Accessible**

   - **Solution**: Verify port mappings. Use `docker ps` to check if the container is running and ports are correctly mapped. Ensure that the host firewall is not blocking the mapped ports.

3. **Image Pull Failures**
   - **Solution**: Check internet connectivity and Docker Hub status. Use `docker pull <image>` to manually pull the image and diagnose issues. Ensure that you are authenticated if pulling from a private repository.

## Gluetun

### Common Issues

1. **VPN Connection Issues**

   - **Solution**: Check VPN provider credentials and configuration. Ensure they are correctly set in the Gluetun container environment variables. Verify that the VPN server is reachable and that your subscription is active.

2. **DNS Issues**

   - **Solution**: Verify DNS settings in the Gluetun configuration. Use `nslookup` to test DNS resolution. Ensure that the DNS servers specified in the configuration are correct and reachable.

3. **Slow Connection Speeds**
   - **Solution**: Test the connection speed without the VPN to isolate the issue. Try different VPN servers to find one with better performance. Check for any bandwidth limitations imposed by the VPN provider.

## Servarr Containers (e.g., Radarr, Sonarr)

### Common Issues

1. **Service Not Starting**

   - **Solution**: Check container logs using `docker logs <container_id>`. Look for specific error messages and resolve them. Ensure that the container has the necessary permissions to access its configuration and data directories.

2. **Connectivity Issues**

   - **Solution**: Ensure correct API keys and URLs are configured. Test connectivity to external services. Verify that the host firewall is not blocking outgoing connections.

3. **Metadata Fetching Failures**
   - **Solution**: Check internet connectivity and the status of the metadata provider. Ensure that the API keys are valid and that the provider's service is not experiencing outages.

## Linux Permission Issues

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied Errors**

   - **Solution**: Use `chmod` to change file permissions and `chown` to change file ownership. Example: `chmod 755 <file>` and `chown user:group <file>`. Verify that the user has the necessary permissions to access the file or directory.

2. **Sudo Command Not Working**

   - **Solution**: Ensure the user is in the sudoers file. Edit `/etc/sudoers` using `visudo` and add the user if necessary. Check for syntax errors in the sudoers file that might prevent it from being parsed correctly.

3. **File System Read-Only**
   - **Solution**: Remount the file system with write permissions using `mount -o remount,rw /`. Check for hardware issues or file system corruption that might cause the file system to be mounted as read-only.

## General Tips

- **Regular Backups**: Always keep backups of your configurations and data. Use tools like `rsync`, `tar`, or dedicated backup software to automate the process.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes of your setup and configurations. Use version control systems like Git to track changes and maintain a history of your configurations.
- **Community Support**: Utilize forums and communities for help and advice. Websites like Stack Overflow, Reddit, and vendor-specific forums can be valuable resources.

By following these tips and solutions, you can effectively troubleshoot and manage your homelab setup.
